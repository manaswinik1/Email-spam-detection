**Email Spam Filtering Project**



Project Description:
The Email Spam Filtering Project is a machine learning application designed to efficiently classify emails into spam and ham (non-spam). Utilizing a dataset of email contents, the project demonstrates the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning in text classification. The core technologies include Python, Pandas for data handling, NLTK for text preprocessing, and Scikit-learn for implementing the SVM classifier. This project addresses the challenge of accurately identifying spam emails, a common issue in email management. Future enhancements may include integrating more complex algorithms and expanding the feature set for improved accuracy.
